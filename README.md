# YaSLP-GUI

YaSLP-GUI is a very userfriendly Graphical Interface wich will only show you servers wich are Online.
You dont need to search for a serverlist. The GUI has 2 built-in Serverlist Databases which are ready to use.
We are 2 Guys who will learn more about how to code in C# so there could be bugs in there.

How to use the GUI?

Download the GUI select a Path where lan-play-client from Spacemeowx2 (https://github.com/spacemeowx2/switch-lan-play) should be located.
Install Winpcap or Npcap with Winpcap Compatibly enabled.
Have Fun.

Whats Diffrent to other GUI's?

Pretty Simple. We use the Greatwizard Database the serverlist from https://github.com/GreatWizard/lan-play-status
and R3n3.at, which is our own Database wich is not finished yet but fully functional on http://slp.r3n3.at/

FAQ:

Q: Can Serverhosters add there servers to the R3n3.at Database?
A: Sure its pretty simple go to http://slp.r3n3.at/ and press "New Server Entry"

Q: Why you made a Second Serverlist?
A: Not everyone is familiar with Github so we made a new list wich is also Userfriendly.

Q: Why did you wanted to not show online Servers?
A: Kutaro wanted it this way because as the Serverlist grows it would be very difficult to find online servers.
